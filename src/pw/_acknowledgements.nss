// Acknowledgment:
// Almost all scripts and functions in the pw subsystems are based on, or direct
//  copies of, Edward Beck's HCR2 persistent world system.  Most have been
//  slightly modified to allow them to work under Michael Sinclair's (Squatting
//  Monk) core-framework system.  Many of the original HCR2 scripts have also
//  been split into different file to ease script maintenance and builder.
//  Any changes made to the script were required solely to make them work within
//  the core-framework structure.
